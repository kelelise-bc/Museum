      <h2>Bringing Light to Forgotten Stories</h2>
      <p>
        Step inside a museum dedicated to the unseen and the unremembered —
        where lost negatives, forgotten rolls of film, and unlabeled prints are
        given new life. Each recovered image reveals fragments of time once
        thought to have vanished.
      </p>
      <p>
        We collect, restore, and recontextualize the photographs left behind —
        honoring the unknown photographers whose vision was nearly erased by
        history.
      </p>
      <p>
        Join us as we piece together stories from light, shadow, and silence.
        <a href="#">Volunteer</a> to help with digitization, research, and
        exhibition preparation.
