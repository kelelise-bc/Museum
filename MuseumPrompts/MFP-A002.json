    "catalogId": "MFP-A002",
    "name": "The Letter That Names No One",
    "material": "Lined cellulose paper, blue iron-gall ink, oxidized metal staple fragment.",
    "estimatedAge": "c. 1960–1963 (based on “Midwest Pulp Co. 59” watermark and ink chemical profile).",
    "locationFound": "Beneath a collapsed metal desk in the administrative office of Grant Street Middle School (Vanished Block excavation zone, Chicago).",
    "likelyPurpose": "Draft of unsent correspondence, possibly a personal or internal note written during school operations.",
    "physicalProperties": "Yellowed surface; light water stain upper-right quadrant; small rust halo near staple puncture; mild mildew scent; fibers weakened along central fold.",
    "culturalContext": "Found among administrative debris including ledger pages, PTA circulars, and student record envelopes.",
    "burialContext": "Layered under plaster and desk-frame debris; embedded dust and carbon ash residue from ceiling collapse.",
    "comparison": "Comparable paper stock and ink type documented in 1950s–60s Chicago Public School correspondence archives.",
    "evidenceOfUse": "Pencil indentation traces from earlier draft beneath ink layer; pooled ink where nib paused mid-line; erased initials “J.L.” faintly visible under raking light near the lower right corner.",
    "foundWith": "Two fragments of manila folder, one labeled “Field Trip Perm.” and another with partial label “Staff.”",
    "manufactureClues": "Watermark “MIDWEST PULP CO. 59”; ruled blue lines printed offset from sheet margin typical of regional stationery mills; staple alloy matches mid-century U.S. office stock.",
    "preservationState": "Fair; structurally intact but brittle; partial legibility loss from moisture exposure; ink feathering along lower edge.",
    "dimensions": "18 × 23 cm; ~6 g; single sheet torn along left margin with slight curl at lower edge.",
    "confidence": "Moderate; ink chemistry verified but contextual link to photographs inferred; textual decoding in progress."

    "discipline": "Analog Archaeologist / Memory Excavator",
    "credentials": "PhD in Archaeology from the University of Edinburgh. Specialized in analog restoration and digital imaging; trained in chemistry, art history, and data preservation. Leads The Excavation Lab at the Museum of Forgotten Photographs. Recipient of the Lumen Foundation Fellowship for ‘Chemical Memory in Damaged Negatives.’",
    "lens": "Material Culture & Cultural Semiotics — examines how light, chemistry, and decay preserve memory in photographic and documentary artifacts.",
    "method": "Analog restoration, microscopic ink and fiber analysis, and archival cross-reference with mid-century Chicago public records to reconstruct context and intent.",
    "purpose": "Exhibit Label (Museum Style) for gallery visitors; ~400 words; interpretive, scholarly-but-approachable tone.\nPurpose: wall-mounted label accompanying artifact; situates the object within the Vanished Block story and explores how ordinary paper becomes a vessel of memory and loss.",
    "reflections": "Believes every fragment rescued from oblivion is an act of resurrection — evidence that memory persists even when identity is erased.",
    "special": "Partially color-blind; perceives tone, shape, and shadow as pure form rather than distraction — an advantage when reading faded documents by texture rather than color."
