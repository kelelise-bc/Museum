    "catalogId": "MFP-A001",
    "name": "The Contact Sheet of the Vanished Block",
    "material": "Resin-coated photographic paper with red and white wax-pencil markings and a small metal staple.",
    "estimatedAge": "c. 1958–1962 (based on film edge codes and paper stock identifiers common in educational settings during that period).",
    "locationFound": "Discovered in the darkroom cabinet of Grant Street Middle School, demolished as part of the Vanished Block redevelopment, Chicago.",
    "likelyPurpose": "Student proof sheet used to evaluate negatives before enlargement or grading.",
    "physicalProperties": "Semi-gloss surface; slightly curled edges; tonal range shows minor silvering at bright areas; faint chemical odor; one corner crease upper right; pencil impressions visible under angled light.",
    "culturalContext": "Found within a school darkroom set containing teaching aids, photography handouts, and class assignment envelopes.",
    "burialContext": "Sealed cabinet behind fallen masonry and collapsed sink plumbing; moderate humidity with faint sulfur residue from water damage.",
    "comparison": "Similar student proof sheets documented in mid-century public school photography programs.",
    "evidenceOfUse": "Grease-pencil crop marks and circled frames; faint smudges from chemical handling; annotation 'print 8×10 #22' in childlike script; staple holes at top margin from envelope attachment.",
    "foundWith": "Two partial rolls of exposed 35 mm film; dried bottle of Kodak Fixer; folded attendance sheet labeled 'Photo Club – Spring Term.'",
    "manufactureClues": "Backstamp 'RC Pearl 59'; perforation codes consistent with Kodak Tri-X Pan film; manufactured in the U.S. circa late 1950s.",
    "preservationState": "Good; stable emulsion; light surface wear; faint rust at staple site; minimal discoloration.",
    "dimensions": "20 × 25 cm; approximately 12 g; rectangular sheet containing 36 negative frames arranged in a 6×6 grid.",
    "confidence": "High; photographic stock, edge codes, and context confirm academic use; chemical stability moderate; provenance verified through site records."

    "discipline": "Analog Archaeologist / Memory Excavator — focuses on recovering and contextualizing photographic and documentary artifacts as cultural memory objects rather than mere images.",
    "credentials": "PhD in Archaeology from the University of Edinburgh; specialized training in analog restoration and digital imaging. Background in chemistry, art history, and data preservation. Leads The Excavation Lab at the Museum of Forgotten Photographs. Recipient of the Lumen Foundation Fellowship for her research 'Chemical Memory in Damaged Negatives.' Her practice bridges scientific analysis and aesthetic empathy—treating each image as a chemical record of time itself.",
    "lens": "Material Culture & Cultural Semiotics — examines how light, chemistry, and decay preserve memory within physical media, and how each layer of damage adds its own language to the artifact.",
    "method": "Uses analog restoration, digital scanning, and archival cross-reference with educational photography archives to reconstruct classroom and community context. Studies how pedagogical artifacts become vessels of shared memory.",
    "purpose": "Website Modal (~150 words) for general visitors; accessible, reflective tone. Purpose is to introduce the artifact as part of an interactive digital exhibit, offering a concise, poetic interpretation of its meaning within the Museum of Forgotten Photographs.",
    "reflections": "Believes every frame she rescues is an act of resurrection — proof that memory endures even when identity is erased. Often reflects that the contact sheet is both map and mirror — a document of light attempting to remember itself.",
    "special": "Partially color-blind; perceives tone, shape, and shadow as pure form rather than distraction — an advantage when restoring faded negatives and photographic paper."
