            <p>
              <strong>Likely Purpose:</strong> Draft of unsent correspondence,
              possibly a personal or internal note written during school
              operations.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Evidence of Use:</strong> Pencil indentation traces from

            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Manufacture Clues:</strong> Watermark “MIDWEST PULP CO.
              59”; ruled blue lines printed offset from sheet margin typical of

              adhered soot/dust particulates
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Size/Weight/Shape:</strong> 24 × 18 cm; ~220 g; irregular
              trapezoid with two factory edges and two fracture edges

            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Estimated Age:</strong> c. 1945–1960 (glass thickness,
              tint, and edge grind typical of mid-century storefront glazing)
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Preservation State:</strong> Partial; surface scratches;
              soot layer fixed in patches; minor edge chipping; no delamination

            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Evidence of Use:</strong> Finger-trace grooves through
              particulate layer (avg. stroke ~2–2.5 cm); oil/salt smudge halos;
              pressure variation at letter starts/stops
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Manufacture Clues:</strong> Soda-lime composition; ground
              long edge; no maker’s mark; sparse bubble inclusions &lt;0.5 mm
              (mid-century plate/rolled glass)
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Cultural Context:</strong> Same layer as signage fragments

            <p>
              <strong>Burial or Habitat Context:</strong> Mixed demolition/fire
              stratum with plaster dust, ash, and brick spall; localized heat
              discoloration on adjacent fragments
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Symbolism:</strong> Plain-text inscription “don’t forget”

            <p>
              <strong>Comparison:</strong> Comparable dust inscriptions recorded
